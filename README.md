# SimpleSocServer
A simple Netty HTTP Server that supports Sockets with various functions surrounding them

## ⚠️ Currently, this Project is in work. There is no documentation and guarentee it will work.
This Project is ment to build a simple Base for many of my Plugins (like SpigotDash) that require Webservers with Socket Support.
Because I don't want to copy the code and have to sync it everytime I change something, this Respository was introduced.

### This is not meant for public use, but if you want you can
Take a look at the Test Main.java File
